## Description
If you always wanted to learn how AI works, this is the course for you. Our course will guide you through the basics of machine learning and show you ways it can be applied in real-world scenarios. No prior machine learning knowledge is required, but you’ll need a solid grasp of Python programming. 

We’ll start with simple examples and provide step-by-step explanations on training machine learning models to make predictions. Then we’ll introduce you to neural networks, where you’ll learn about more advanced models that drive recent AI advancements. Additionally, we’ll cover models like ChatGPT, showing you how they are trained and how to build applications using them.

By the end of the course, you'll have practical skills and a solid foundation in machine learning, ready to create your own projects.

## The course materials

In this course, we’ll guide you through five clear and straightforward notebooks that introduce you to cutting-edge concepts. Each notebook has two versions:

- A basic version has several simple coding tasks that will help you to get a grasp on the material,
- A version with solutions has all the tasks solved, so you can consult them if you get stuck or if you want to check yourself.

## Key Topics

- Basic machine learning principles
- Linear classifier
- Transformers for texts and images
- ChatGPT architecture
- CLIP model architecture
- HuggingFace libraries: datasets, transformers
- OpenAI API, LangChain
